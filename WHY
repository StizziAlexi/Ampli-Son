Hello everyone,

I am Stizzi Alexi, a student from ESEO Angers, an engineering school in France. I have a passion for electronics and sound.

In our second semester of the first year of the engineering cycle, we don't have many electronics lectures. 
However, I am interested in installing a sound system in my apartment.
