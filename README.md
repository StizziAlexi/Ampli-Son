# Ampli-Son

Hello everyone,

I am Stizzi Alexi, a student from ESEO in Angers, France. I created this project to apply some of my knowledge in electronics, I want to installe a pair of speakers and an audio amplifier in my house. 

This is the first part of my project, I want to create a mix of a transitor amplifier and a tube amp to had the best sound experience. I begin with a transistor amplifier because it's easier and doesn't involve high voltage (I don't have the knowledge to do it safely). In the second part I want to create a tube amp with the same speaker and finally combine the two amplifier and create a new speaker.

For the first part I use a LM4766 from Texas Instrument and speakers found on internet.
