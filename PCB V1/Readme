This is the first version of the PCB.

In this version there is a problem, is missing a GND port for the jack pin. If it's missing we can hear "noises" in our sound, because
the PCB, speakers are on the same ground but not our signal ("In this case my cellphone").

They are missing the convertissor AC to DC and the regulator to adapt the voltage form 230V to 30v or 24V it depend of the price and 
how much tension I loses from my conversion. 

But i can buy one from internet, so I don't need to work with high voltage, and that saves me some work, and I don't have any idea 
how I can develop one.
