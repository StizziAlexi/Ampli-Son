AC to DC converter and voltage regulation.

My initial idea for a converter was very basic and incorrect. I created a diode bridge to rectify the AC voltage, and then added a filter to achieve a constant voltage output. However, when I showed it to one of my professors, he informed me that my approach was incorrect (though he did not explain why; I intend to ask him for clarification). Instead, he suggested adding a transformer before the diode bridge and using voltage regulators (such as the 7824 for +24V and 7924 for -24V) to regulate the voltage.

P.S.: I am about to model my circuit to illustrate the different cases.
