Convertissor AC to DC and the regulation of the voltage. 

My first idea of a convertissor was very basic and wrong. I created a diode bridge where 
I take the positive and negative voltage and had a filter to have a constant amount of voltage. 
But when I show it to one of my proffesor he tell me I was wrong to do it 
(I don't know why, I want to ask him why). And he tell me to had a transformator 
before my diode bridge and use voltage regulators (7824 for +24V and 7924 for -24V) to regulate my voltage.

PS: I am about to modelisate my scheme to show the different case.
