I use the software from Texas Instrument call TINA-TI.

It the first time where I use this software and learn a bit about it, I didn't reach all the potential of the soft but it 
was interesting.

Why I use it, beacause I didn't found an alternative in LTspyce and didn't succeed to create a library of it.
